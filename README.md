Hi, I’m Max.

I’m a Python backend developer with an engineering background, focused on building clean, well-structured APIs and data-driven systems. My work emphasizes strong fundamentals, clear abstractions, and pragmatic use of modern tooling.

Current focus
- Backend engineering fundamentals: APIs, data models, validation, architecture
- Python ecosystem: FastAPI, NumPy, Pandas
- Applied engineering projects with real technical constraints
- AI-assisted development workflows (Cursor) to accelerate iteration without sacrificing code quality

Flagship project
- Bendbionics  
  A FastAPI-based backend project rooted in engineering and mathematical modeling.  
  Focus areas include API design, structured parameter handling, and numerical computation using NumPy.

Background
I’m transitioning into software development from a mechanical engineering background. This strongly influences how I approach code: system-level thinking, correctness, and maintainability over quick hacks.

Learning direction
I’m currently deepening backend fundamentals, expanding into scientific Python (NumPy, Pandas), and plan to move into applied machine learning with PyTorch once the foundation is solid.
